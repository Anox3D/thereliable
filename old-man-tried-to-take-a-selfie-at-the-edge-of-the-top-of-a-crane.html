                <h1>Old man tried to take a selfie at the edge of the top of a crane</h2>
                <p>The third of September, an elderly man has climbed at the top of a crane in a construction site at Glendale, in Arizona, attempting to take a selfie from this view. Not paying attention to the fact that he was getting closer from the edge, the man has done a free-fall and landed in the trailer of a passing truck, flattened. There were a lot of pedestrians around this shocking scene, all have witnessed it. The driver of the truck has been giving a psychological help because of the trauma that this event caused.

                We had the chance to interview the family of the dead one. We ask them what was their reaction after the death of their beloved old man in the family.
                <br>
                His daughter: “Oh my god, I was SO shocked after that he passed out, OMG. I couldn’t even get up at morn. Yeah, yeah, I was really really sad, gosh. Uh-huh.”
                <br>
                His grandson: “Meh, nevermind… He was a stupid dummy dumb guy anyway. Hope I get the inheritance.”
                <br>
                His wife: “…” – Died of ligma seven years ago.
                <br>
                Some of his friends: “Anderson who?”
                <br>
                <br>
                As we saw, death can be easy to reach, maybe climbing at the top of a crane wasn’t a really good idea. We can also learn a lesson from this, doing extravagant things for just a selfie, likes and other things like that is not a good idea and can lead to death.</p>
